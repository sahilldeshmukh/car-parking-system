# ðŸš— Smart Car Parking System

This is a mini-project titled **"Smart Car Parking System"** developed as part of the Embedded and IoT Technology course during Semester II of the M.Sc. Computer Science program at the University of Mumbai.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Urban areas face increasing challenges with traffic congestion and inefficient parking. This project proposes a **Smart Car Parking System** that uses IoT technologies to automate and simplify the parking process. The goal is to **minimize human intervention** and enable automatic detection and assignment of parking slots using **PIR sensors** and **Arduino**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Detect car arrival using sensors.
- Assign available parking space automatically.
- Display parking slot availability on a serial monitor (virtual terminal in Proteus).
- Minimize human interaction and reduce time spent on finding parking.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Proteus** (Simulation)
- **Arduino UNO**
- **PIR Sensors**
- **C++/Arduino IDE**
- **Serial Monitor / Virtual Terminal**
